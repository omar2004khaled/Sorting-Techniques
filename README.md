# Sorting Algorithms Assignment

This project implements and compares three sorting algorithms:
1. Insertion Sort (O(nÂ²))
2. Merge Sort (O(n log n))
3. Radix Sort (O(n))

## How to Run
1. Compile and run `Main.java`.
2. Provide the path to the input file (e.g., `input.txt`).
3. Choose a sorting algorithm and whether to return intermediate arrays.
